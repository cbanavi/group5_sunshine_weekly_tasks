# JAVA SDET WINTER 2023
## Setting up Github project:
Team  members should clone the project from the GitHub repository  
Everyone should create his/her own branch in IntelliJ and work on it to avoid Git conflicts.  
Use your name as the branch name.

### Naming conventions for classes:
Create package under src folder and name it after you (ex.Chiyavan).  
Then create a subpackage under your folder called week1_template or whatever the appropriate week is.  
Then create your classes for the week under your subpackage (ex. finra_Chiyavan).  
You can see Chiyavan's branch as an example.

For naming convention; after the "classname" (the classname might have the related week's java task name or something else)
you may use your name initials or etc.  
Classname Examples:   `Finra_Admir`    or   `MergeTwoArrays_AR`

### Git-Github Flow Reminder:  
1. Accept the invitation and then clone the project  
2. First make sure you are on your own local branch. (If this is your first time and if you don’t have a local branch, first create your own local branch from the master branch and checkout to it.)  
3. Right-click local master-> click Update (without checking out to the master branch itself)     📌  
4. Right click local master -> click "Merge master into "your own branch""  
5. Start writing your codes.  
6. Commit your changes  
7. Once you are done with your all job, follow steps "3 and 4 again"📌 🚨 📌 🚨  
to be able to avoid extra conflicts and if you have any, IntelliJ will show you the conflict with its own style.  
-If any conflicts happen, resolve that conflict on your IntelliJ UI by keeping both of the changes (yours and theirs) most of the time.  
This is the most reasonable solving style for conflicts in most cases since your coworkers will already have some changes on remote based on their own job.  
8. Push your branch. (before pushing: have you done steps 3-4 again? don't forget this 🤝 )  
9.  Create your PR (Pull Request) on GitHub website.  
(I suggest you guys not use IntelliJ UI for creating your PRs.)  
10. Assign your review-mate for peer-review process. (make sure you are merging from "your branch" to the "master" branch📌  
11. Code owner/reviewer merges his/her custom branch after the review is done/approved.  

You can complete all this flow above for each task once it is done individually.🤝  
If possible every day, so that you can also practice the git-github collaboration process 📌 🤝
